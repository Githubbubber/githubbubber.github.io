                <strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                GMP secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
                disclosure. GMP uses the following methods for this purpose:
                <br />
                <br />
                - SSL Protocol
                <br />
                <br />
                When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to
                other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the
                Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
                <br />
                <br />
                We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against
                unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information.
                Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
                network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
                to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are
                security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond
                our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all
                information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot
                be guaranteed.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Right to Deletion</strong>
                <br />

                request from you, we will:

                Please note that we may not be able to comply with requests to delete your
                personal information if it is necessary to:
                <br />

                requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our

                â€¢ Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical
                research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable
                ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of the information is likely to
                render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research,
                provided we have obtained your informed consent;
                <br />
                â€¢ Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your
                expectations based on your relationship with us;
                <br />
                â€¢ Comply with an existing legal obligation; or
                <br />
                â€¢ Otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner
                that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information.
